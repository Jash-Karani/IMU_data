1.Setup ros package
2. Read articles/ watched youtube videos to understand IMU data
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20htSO0z-F4 (this video helped a lot)
3.Made the publisher.py file
4.Thought that by using multiprocessing i can run two functions a the same time
	-one funtion will count 10 seconds
	-the second function will change the acc values in small increments
5.used the time library
	found and error in catkin_make :
	CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  	Could not find a package configuration file provided by "time" with any of
  	the following names:

    	timeConfig.cmake
    	time-config.cmake

6.From the above youtube video i learnt all about the Imu object, and the vector object.. and i practised changing and publishing their values... now all that is left is the acc increment part
7.using multiprocessing didnt really work ... so i am rethinking the process
8.I decided to use the time difference as the increment value 
9.used time.time() to get current time and used initial time to get difference 
10. simply incremented the values nad published them
11.didnt get a consistent increase with this method though
11. next i thought... the loop is runnig at 10 Hz
	-that means it runs 10 times a seconds
	-this means that every loop should have the same runtime
	so i tried to increment values every loop 
	-this however didnt work as the loop time was a bit different for every iteratio 
	(i have attached a screenshot of the terminal output that shows the same)
12. ran out of time .. so i stuck with the initial method
13. still searching for solution where the increment is the same
