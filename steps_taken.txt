1.Setup ros package
2. Read articles/ watched youtube videos to understand IMU data
	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20htSO0z-F4 (this video helped a lot)
3.Made the publisher.py file
4.Thought that by using multiprocessing i can run two functions a the same time
	-one funtion will count 10 seconds
	-the second function will change the acc values in small increments
5.used the time library
	found and error in catkin_make :
	CMake Error at /opt/ros/noetic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  	Could not find a package configuration file provided by "time" with any of
